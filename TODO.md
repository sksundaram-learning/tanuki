# TODO

## General Items

1. Pagination links should have "..." where additional pages exist.
1. Race condition in thinning of thumbnails may cause a request to fail
1. Instead of a "topic" field, perhaps an "occasion" field instead.
    - For instance, "christina birthday".
    - Add back to incoming processor using the "^" separator.
    - Would be on details/edit page for benefit of uploading.
    - Maybe don't bother exposing on main page, just another field like caption.
1. Request caching should be keyed by some unique value per browser session
    - With some upper limit on simultaneous cached queries
1. For large numbers of pages, maybe some "skip" links
    - On the `year` page, show links to jump to the page with the first asset in each month
    - On the `index` page, show links to jump to 10% mark, 20% mark, and so on
    - On the `location` page, show links to jump to 10% mark, 20% mark, and so on
1. Option on `edit` page to rotate an image (some images lack orientation data)
1. To help reduce tag clutter, hide the tags whose count falls below a threshold
    - Show the full list of tags dynamically using JavaScript (via a link)
1. Write tests for the `tanuki_web` application
1. Consider supporting browsing by year and month (likely without query caching or paging)
1. Fix image references in error view
    - When Phoenix has an error, it tries to refer to default images
1. Add functions to admin page:
    - Button to perform database compaction
