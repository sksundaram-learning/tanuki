    - [ ] Look at using Elixir and Phoenix for the web interface
    - [ ] Incorporate version information into page footer
    - [ ] Add pagination support to `tag.erl`
      - Look at the paginate plugin: https://github.com/choptastic/paginate
      - http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/recipes.html
          - Request rows_per_page + 1 rows from the view
          - Display rows_per_page rows
          - Store the +1 row as next_startkey and next_startkey_docid
          - As page information, keep startkey and next_startkey
          - Use the next_* values to create the next link
          - Use the others (startkey?) to create the previous link
      - An entirely different approach: https://gist.github.com/amedeo/820412
    - [ ] Store tag selection in page state (e.g. `wf:state(Key, Value)`)
    - [ ] Short intersecting tags based on current tag selection
    - [ ] Show an `x` next to each tag on `tag.erl` to drop that tag from the query
    - [ ] Get the list of tags in `tag.erl` to be along the side of the images
    - [ ] Have the thumbnails on `tag.erl` appear in a grid format
    - [ ] Organize the assets by date in `tag.erl`
    - [ ] Option to select assets by file extension (e.g. `.jpg` or `.mov`)
      - Create a CouchDB view on filename extensions to make it easy to select
    - [ ] Have `asset.erl` show a larger version of the image instead of thumbnail
    - [ ] Fetch additional details of the image for display in `asset.erl`
    - [ ] Display available dates (year, then months) on `index.erl`
    - [ ] Display assets by date (with pagination?) in a new `date.erl` page
    - [ ] Use ETS to cache the tags and such in memory of `tanuki_backend` process
      - Cache invalidation via couchbeam change listeners
      - Could use https://github.com/nitrogen/simple_cache
    - [ ] Produce thumbnails for the videos and cache them
      - https://github.com/emedia-project/erlffmpeg
    - [ ] Show list of known locations along with the list of tags
    - [ ] Show list of known topics along with the list of tags, locations

  ** Documentation
    - [ ] Write an architecture document that explains the components
      - CouchDB
        - couchbeam
      - Incoming
      - Backend
      - Frontend
        - Phoenix
          - Cowboy
          - Plug
        - Elixir
      - Describe how pages are rendered (Phoenix endpoints, router, controllers, views)
