    - [ ] Add pagination support to tags list
      - http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/recipes.html
          - Request rows_per_page + 1 rows from the view
          - Display rows_per_page rows
          - Store the +1 row as next_startkey and next_startkey_docid
          - As page information, keep startkey and next_startkey
          - Use the next_* values to create the next link
          - Use the others (startkey?) to create the previous link
      - An entirely different approach: https://gist.github.com/amedeo/820412
